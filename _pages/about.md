I am a second-year PhD student at the University of Texas at Austin, 
supervised by Professor [Mingyuan Zhou](https://mingyuanzhou.github.io/). 
Before joining UT, I obtained my master's degree in Statistics from the University of Chicago, 
where I closely collaborated with [Kevin Bello](https://kevinsbello.github.io/), 
[Bryon Aragam](https://www.bryonaragam.com/), [Pradeep Ravikumar](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~pradeepr/), 
 [Francesco Locatello](https://www.francescolocatello.com/), 
and supervised by Professor [Jingshu Wang](https://jingshuw.org/). 
I earned my Bachelor's degree in Statistics from Fudan University, 
where I spent some of the most memorable moments of my life.


Research Interests: I have broad research interests in statistical machine learning. 
Specifically, my research interests lie in:

- **Generative Models**: e.g., diffusion models, VAEs, and inverse problems.
- **Reinforcement Learning**.
- **Causal Inference**: e.g., graphical probabilistic models, causal representation learning.
- **Statistical Sampling**: e.g., neural posterior sampling.
- **Bioinformatics**: e.g., single-cell data and multi-omic data integration.

I am open to Summer Internship 2025 opportunities. ‚òÄÔ∏è Please don't hesitate to contact me if you see a good fit or have an opportunity for me. üìß
